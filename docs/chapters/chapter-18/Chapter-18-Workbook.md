### **Theoretical Background**

Classical Monte Carlo methods are a cornerstone of financial engineering, used to estimate the expected payoff of derivatives by averaging outcomes from numerous random simulations. If we want to find the expected value $\mathbb{E}[f(x)]$ of a payoff function $f(x)$ over a random variable $x$, we can approximate it by drawing $N$ samples:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)
$$

According to the Central Limit Theorem, the error of this estimation scales as $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$. To improve precision by a factor of 10, one must increase the number of samples by a factor of 100.

**Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)** offers a powerful alternative. It reframes the problem as estimating an amplitude in a quantum state. By encoding the expected value into an amplitude, QAE can achieve an estimation error that scales as $\mathcal{O}(1/M)$, where $M$ is the number of quantum queries. This provides a **quadratic speedup** over its classical counterpart.

The QAE framework for option pricing involves several key steps:
1.  **State Preparation:** A quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ is prepared to encode the probability distribution of the underlying random variable (e.g., the stock's terminal price, $S_T$).
    $$
    |\psi\rangle = \sum_{x} \sqrt{p(x)} |x\rangle
    $$
2.  **Payoff Encoding:** A controlled rotation operator, $R_f$, encodes the payoff function $f(x)$ into the amplitude of an ancilla qubit.
    $$
    R_f |x\rangle|0\rangle = |x\rangle \left( \sqrt{1 - f(x)} |0\rangle + \sqrt{f(x)} |1\rangle \right)
    $$
3.  **Amplitude Estimation:** QAE is applied to estimate the probability of measuring the ancilla qubit in the $|1\rangle$ state, which corresponds to the expected payoff $\mathbb{E}[f(x)]$.
4.  **Discounting:** The final option price is obtained by multiplying the expected payoff by the classical discount factor $e^{-rT}$, where $r$ is the risk-free rate and $T$ is the time to maturity.

Despite its power, QAE faces challenges, such as the complexity of preparing the initial state $|\psi\rangle$ for arbitrary distributions and the large circuit depth required for the Grover-like iterations within QAE. Variants like **Iterative QAE (IQAE)** have been developed to mitigate these issues by adaptively estimating the amplitude without requiring deep circuits.

!!! abstract "Interview-Style Question"
    **Q:** Quantify the performance difference between classical Monte Carlo and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) in terms of computational complexity, assuming both are seeking the same accuracy $\epsilon$.

    ???+ info "Answer Strategy"
        The performance difference is a **quadratic speedup** in favor of the quantum approach. This can be quantified by analyzing how the required number of computational steps scales with the desired accuracy, $\epsilon$.

        1.  **Classical Monte Carlo:**
            *   **Error Scaling:** The error of a classical Monte Carlo simulation decreases with the number of samples $N$ as $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$.
            *   **Complexity:** To achieve a target accuracy $\epsilon$, we need the error to be at most $\epsilon$. Therefore, $1/\sqrt{N} \approx \epsilon$, which means the required number of samples $N$ scales as $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$.

        2.  **Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE):**
            *   **Error Scaling:** The error of QAE decreases with the number of quantum queries $M$ as $\mathcal{O}(1/M)$.
            *   **Complexity:** To achieve the same accuracy $\epsilon$, we need $1/M \approx \epsilon$, which means the required number of queries $M$ scales as $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$.

        **Conclusion:**
        To get 10x more accuracy (decreasing $\epsilon$ by a factor of 10), the classical method requires 100x more work, while the quantum method requires only 10x more work. This quadratic difference in scaling ($1/\epsilon^2$ vs. $1/\epsilon$) is the source of the quantum advantage.

| **Verification Goal**    | Confirm that for $\epsilon = 10^{-3}$, $N = 1,000,000$ and $M = 1,000$, yielding a speedup of 1,000x.                                                                                                                                     |

#### **Outcome and Interpretation**

The results clearly demonstrate the power of quantum computation for this problem. To achieve a pricing accuracy of 0.1%, a classical Monte Carlo simulation requires one million samples. In contrast, QAE requires only one thousand queries to the quantum computer. This represents a **1,000x speedup**, making calculations that might be prohibitively expensive classically far more tractable on future quantum hardware. This quadratic advantage is a defining feature of quantum algorithms in finance.
